I am an ecologist who got amazed about the fact that tiny creatures have shaped our planet and still play essential trophic & bigeochemical roles at a planetary scale. I generally attempt to bring together ecological theory and microbial omics data to investigate the distribution, structure and function of microbial communities inhabiting both marine & freshwater ecosystems.

I am a PhD student between in the [Laboratory of Microbial Processes & Biodiversity](http://www.lmpb.ufscar.br/) (UFSCar, Brazil) and the [Ecology of Marine Microorganisms Research group](https://emm.icm.csic.es/), based at the [Institut de Ciències del Mar](https://www.icm.csic.es/en) (ICM-CSIC, Barcelona) where I am currently conducting a project on large-scale ecology & biogeography of marine planktonic communities using Metabarcoding, Metagenomics & Single Cell Genomics.
